NOTES

The page should refresh automatically only if you are showing today's data.

It refreshes once a minute. Most of the plots are also updated every minute,
so what you see you could be up to two minutes behind. Spectrograms could be
up to six minutes behind.

If you are displaying data for today, the date of the displayed plot will be
automatically updated at midnight UTC. The script might not be able to find
the plot for the first minute of the new day.

If there is more than one plot for a given day, they will all be shown as
thumbnails, linked to the full-size plots.

The page only lists the stations that are available for the selected plot
type and date.

If a partial plot is shown, or no plot at all, you have probably requested a
plot at the same time as the file is being written. Wait a minute or two and
try again, or try another station.

Firefox seems to have problems displaying some image files. Press Shift - Reload.

This script requires two scripts in /home/webobs/src/seismic_plot_viewer/ to
be running as daily cronjobs to update the database:
- update_mlocate.pl
- check_holdings.sh

PLOT TYPES

Helicorder
Traditional helicorder plots of vertical broad-band or short-period data, as
produced by the station. These are updated every minute.

Short-period helicorder
Helicorder plots from short-period stations, along with plots of broad-band
data filtered with a 1Hz high-pass filter to mimic a short-period signal.
These are updated every minute.

Wide helicorder
Landscape-shaped helicorder plots using short-period data (original or
filtered). These are updated every minute.

Multiple helicorder
Combined helicorder plots from groups of stations. These are generated at
the end of each day.

Spectrogram
Spectrogram plots of vertical broad-band or short-period data, as produced
by the station. These are updated every 5 minutes. The spectrogram module in
earthwom is crash-prone, so data availability is patchy.

Pan plot
Combined ("panacea") plots showing helicorder, spectrogram, waveform and RMS
of BB and SP vertical data. These are generated at the end of each day.

Scanned helicorder
Scanned paper helicorder plots from the 1995-1996 MVO analogue network. 

Displacement helicorder
Helicorder plots showing the integrated signal from selected broad-band
vertical stations. These are updated every minute.

Infrasound helicorder
Helicorder plot showing infrasonic data from seismic stations equipped with
an infrasound sensor.

Very-long period seismic data
Plots of integrated vertical seismic data from selected broad-band station
after filtering with a 0.003 - 0.1 Hz bandpass filter. These are generated at
the end of each day.

Strain
Strain data from CALIPSO stations, unfiltered and filtered with a 0.1 Hz
lowpass filter. These are updated once an hour, at 20 minutes past.

Strain pan plot
Unfiltered strain data from CALIPSO stations, in a combined plot showing
helicorder, spectrogram, signal and RMS.
