bugs
notWebobs often shows partial images or no image. OK in Webobs
check scanned station names
check if all scanned files are also tifs
check spectrogram plots
title is weird
doesn't keep mobile layout on auto-refresh, unless on mobile device
if more than one plot for a MBRV BHZ, it also shows SHZ


NB: Needs go+x permissions to run in apache
